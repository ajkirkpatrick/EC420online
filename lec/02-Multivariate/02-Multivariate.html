Motivation

### [top](#Overview)




---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

### Multivariate regression is the estimation of the PRF:
`$$E[Y | X_1, X_2] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$`



### Where we previously had PRF:

`$$E[Y|X] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$`



----

### The SRF for two variables is:

`$$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 x_2$$`



### We still have one error term, `\(u\)`

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i,1} + \beta_2 x_{i,2} + u_i$$`
### And we estimate `\(\hat{\beta} = \{\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2 \}\)` the same way.


---
class: MSU

# Multivariate regression

### Examples
- We want to explain country-level *life expectancy* as a function of *gdp per capita* and *population growth*.
`$$LifeExp_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 gdppc_i + \beta_2 popgrowth_i + u_i$$`


- We want to explain *mortality rate* with *number of cigarettes smoked* and *average daily caloric intake*
`$$Mortality_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 cigarettes_i + \beta_2 calories_i + u_i$$`

- We want to explain *wage* with *education* and *ability*:
`$$Wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ_i + \beta_2 ability_i + u_i$$`
---
class:MSU
# Multivariate regression


## Ceteris Paribus - *all else held equal*
`$$Wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ_i + \beta_2 ability_i + u_i$$`


We interpret `\(\beta_1\)` as "the effect of `\(educ\)` on the expectation of `\(wage\)`, *all else held equal*"

What other random variables are we holding equal?:
- `\(ability\)`
--

- `\(u\)` too!

--

## This means:
`\(\beta_1 = \frac{\Delta Wage}{\Delta educ}\)` when `\(\underbrace{\Delta ability = \Delta u = 0}_{\text{all else held equal}}\)`



---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## And a similar interpretation for `\(\beta_2\)`
We interpret `\(\beta_2\)` as "the effect of `\(experience\)` on the expectation of `\(wage\)`, *all else held equal*"


## This means:
`\(\beta_2 = \frac{\Delta Wage}{\Delta ability}\)` when `\(\underbrace{\Delta educ = \Delta u = 0}_{\text{all else held equal}}\)`

----

--

Does this require that `\(\frac{\Delta educ}{\Delta experience}\)` be zero?

Nope. But we are measuring the effect of one *while holding the other equal to zero*.

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## We can interpret `\(\beta_0\)` as:
`\(\beta_0 = E[wage]\)` when `\(educ\)` and `\(ability\)` **and** `\(u=0\)`

### This is because:
`$$E[wage|educ,ability] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + \beta_2 ability$$`
or, in general notation

`$$E[Y|x_1, x_2] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$`

A slightly different interpretation, and unique to the `\(\beta_0\)`.

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

### What if we *should* use two variables, but we only use one?

We could run the regression `\(wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ_i + u_i\)`, but we probably think `\(ability_i\)` also affects wages.

What if we don't observe `\(ability_i\)`?
- Just because we don't observe it doesn't mean it isn't affecting `\(wage_i\)`
- It *is present in the error term*. 
- Let's make a new variable called `\(\tilde{u} = \delta_1 ability_i + u_i\)`

`$$wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ_i + \underbrace{\delta_1 ability_i + u_i}_{\tilde{u}_i}$$`

  - Note: usually the `\(\sim\)` over a coefficient or variable (like `\(\tilde{u}\)`) will indicate it is related to, but different from, the non- `\(\sim\)` version.

  - `\(\delta_1\)` is just the effect of `\(ability\)` on `\(wage\)`



---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

### We can naively write this as a single variable regression:

`$$wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ_i + \tilde{u}_i$$`

--

## But wait!

- We think `\(E[ability|educ]&gt;0\)`

  - Then this violates the assumption that `\(E[\tilde{u}|X] = 0\)`

Because 

1. `\(\frac{\Delta \tilde{u}}{\Delta ability} = \delta_1 \neq 0\)`

2. `\(\frac{\Delta ability}{\Delta educ} \neq 0\)`

`\(\Rightarrow \frac{\Delta \tilde{u}}{\Delta educ} \neq 0\)`


---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

### Bias

Recall that we could show `\(E[\hat{\beta}_1]=\beta_1\)` if and only if `\(E[u|X]=0\)`.

Looking at `\(\tilde{u}_i = \delta_1 ability_i + u_i\)`, we can see why `\(E[\tilde{u}|educ]\neq 0\)`

- Thus, `\(\beta_1\)` in the single-variable regression was **biased**.



---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

#### Adding in `\(ability\)` as a second variable fixes this:
`$$wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ_i + \beta_2 ability_i + u_i$$`

because `\(u_i\)` does not change with `\(educ\)` or `\(ability\)`.

Now, `\(E[u|X_1, X_2] = E[u|educ, ability] = 0\)`

We brought the problem, `\(ability\)`, out of the error term.

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## Multivariate regression allows us to account for the effect of both `\(ability\)` and `\(educ\)`

`$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + \beta_2 ability + u$$`

And we can calculate the change in `\(wage\)` from any change in `\(ability\)` and `\(educ\)` using the SRF:

`$$\Delta\widehat{wage} = \widehat{\beta_1} \Delta educ + \widehat{\beta_2} \Delta ability$$`

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## This also means our assumption is now:

`$$E[u|educ, wage] = 0$$`

## Which we write in general as:

`$$E[u|x_1, x_2]=0$$`


Which is to say that we think we've got everything that could potentially be correlated with `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_2\)` out of the error term.


--

Since we want to work with some sample data (wage2.dta from Wooldridge), let's replace `\(ability\)` with `\(experience\)`, which is in the dataset....


---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

When we estimate `\(wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ_i + \beta_2 experience_i + u_i\)`, we are fitting a *plane*:

Estimating Multivariate Regression 

# and Partialling Out

### [top](#Overview)


---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## How do we estimate `\(\hat{\beta}\)`?

Remember our two assumptions that let us derive `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_0\)`:
`$$E[u] = 0,\quad E[u|x] = 0$$`

--

Now, we want to estimate `\(\hat{\beta} = \{ \hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2\}\)`
- And we have two `\(x\)`'s: `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_2\)`.

`$$E[u] = 0, \quad E[u|x_1] = 0, \quad E[u|x_2] = 0$$`

We have **three** moment conditions, and three unknowns to estimate. We can do that!

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## These three moment conditions give us the following to start with:
`$$E[y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_1 - \beta_1 x_2] = E[u]= 0$$`
`$$E[x_1(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_1 - \beta_1 x_2)] = E[x_1 u] = 0$$`
`$$E[x_2(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_1 - \beta_1 x_2)] = E[x_2 u] = 0$$`

---

class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

### But don't worry, we won't derive them directly from this, but that's how we would do it.

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

### Let's talk notation for a second:

- I will use `\(\beta\)` as the coefficients we are estimating ( `\(\hat{\beta}\)` )
- When talking about the right hand side (the covariates), I'll either call them `\(x_1\)`, `\(x_2, \cdots\)`
  - Or sometimes just using the variable names: `\(wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ\)`
  - Or sometimes with subscripts: `\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_{educ} x_{educ} + u\)`
  
- And sometimes, if we want to emphasize that two regressions are wholly different, I will use `\(\delta\)` or `\(\gamma\)` instead of `\(\beta\)`

- `\(u\)` and `\(v\)` will represent errors in two different regressions
---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## Partialing out
Imagine if we had two `\(x\)`'s, `\(x_{temp}\)` and `\(x_{rain}\)` that both had an effect on `\(y\)`, but were closely related.

We could look at `\(\beta_{temp}\)` in
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_{temp} x_{temp} + u$$`

And `\(\beta_{rain}\)` in 
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_{rain} x_{rain} + u$$`

We learned from the previous section that `\(\beta_{temp}\)` is biased when `\(x_{rain}\)` is in the error term `\(u\)`, and vice versa.

That is, `\(\beta_{temp}\)` is going to "pick up some of the effect" of `\(x_{rain}\)`.

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## Partialing out
So, would `\(\tilde{\beta}_{temp}\)` in the following (correct) specification equal `\(\beta_{temp}\)` from the previous slide?
`$$y = \tilde{\beta}_0 + \tilde{\beta}_{temp} x_{temp} + \tilde{\beta}_{rain} x_{rain} + \tilde{u}$$`
--

## No!

Once we include both variables, we will get a different estimate for `\(\tilde{\beta}\)` than before since each effect is isolated (*ceteris paribus*) 

So, to calculate the correct `\(\tilde{\beta}_{temp}\)`, we need estimates that take the effect of `\(\tilde{\beta}_{rain}\)` into consideration.

This is called **partialing out**.

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## One way we can estimate unbiased `\(\beta_{temp}\)` is the following way:

First, estimate the regression of `\(x_{temp}\)` on `\(x_{rain}\)`
`$$x_{temp} = \delta_0 + \delta_{rain} x_{rain} + v$$`

Couple of things:
- `\(x_{temp}\)` is on the left hand side. 
- **We are "explaining temperature with rainfall"**
- Using `\(\delta\)` to show that these are different coefficients

--

That error term, `\(v\)` has an interpretation
- `\(v\)` is the `\(temp\)` that is **not explained by** `\(rain\)`
- `\(\delta_{rain}x_{rain}\)` is the `\(temp\)` that **is** explained by `\(rain\)`

#### `\(v\)` is `\(temp\)` that has had `\(rain\)` "partialed out"

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## Of course, we have a sample analog for `\(v\)`, the SRF residuals:
`$$\hat{v} = x_{temp} - (\hat{\delta}_0 + \hat{\delta}_{rain} x_{rain})$$`

Remember, `\(v\)` still varies along with `\(x_{temp}\)`, but it is not correlated at *all* with `\(x_{rain}\)`.

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

### Now, if we want to get the correct value for `\(\beta_{temp}\)` in the full regression:
`$$y = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \hat{v} + u$$`

- We do not use `\(x_{rain}\)` directly.

- We use `\(\hat{v}\)` and leave `\(x_{rain}\)` out. 

- `\(\hat{v}\)` is correlated with `\(x_{temp}\)`, but not with `\(x_{rain}\)`

- Put another way, `\(\hat{v}\)` contains only the part of `\(x_{temp}\)` that is not correlated with `\(x_{rain}\)`.

## One can show that `\(\gamma_1 = \tilde{\beta}_{temp}\)`

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## One can show that `\(\gamma_1 = \tilde{\beta}_{temp}\)`, the unbiased estimate.

That is, we get the (unbiased) coefficient one would get from regressing 

`$$y = \tilde{\beta}_0 + \tilde{\beta}_{temp} x_{temp} + \tilde{\beta}_{rain} x_{rain} + \tilde{u}$$` 

by first "partialing" `\(x_{rain}\)` out of `\(x_{temp}\)` then regressing what is left on `\(y\)`.



---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

Similarly, one can do the same for `\(x_{rain}\)`:
`$$x_{rain} = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 x_{temp} + w$$`

Then use the residuals, `\(\hat{w}\)`, in a regression:
`$$y = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{w} + \epsilon$$`

And `\(\tilde{\beta}_{rain} = \alpha_1\)`

--

Since `\(\hat{\tilde{\beta}}_{rain} = \hat{\alpha}_1 = \frac{Cov(y,\hat{w})}{Var(\hat{w})}\)`, we can say that `\(\beta_{rain}\)` is the effect of `\(x_{rain}\)` *once we've taken out the effect of* `\(x_{temp}\)` and vice versa.

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

Since we get the same `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` if we
- Partial out the effect of `\(x_2\)` and run a single variable regression, or
- Run a two-variable regression

Then we can think of the `\(\tilde{\beta}_1\)` in:

`$$y = \tilde{\beta}_0 + \tilde{\beta}_1 x_1 + \tilde{\beta}_2 x_2 + \tilde{u}$$`
As the effect of `\(x_1\)` on `\(y\)` **after partialing `\(x_2\)` out of `\(x_1\)`**, and vice versa.

### Multivariate regression automatically partials out each of the `\(x's\)`.
---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

## Let's compare a simple and multiple regression estimates
- `\(y = \tilde{\beta}_0 + \tilde{\beta}_1 x_1 + \tilde{\beta}_2 x_2 + \tilde{u}\)`
- `\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + u\)`

How will `\(\tilde{\beta}_1\)` differ from `\(\beta_1\)`?

--

It depends on the relationship between `\(x_2\)` and `\(x_1\)`
`$$x_2 = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_1 + v$$`

If we take `\(x_2 = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_1 + v\)` and substitute it into the first equation above:
`$$y = \tilde{\beta}_0 + \tilde{\beta}_1 x_1 + \tilde{\beta}_2 (\delta_0 + \delta_1 x_1 + v) + \tilde{u}$$`
`$$y = \tilde{\beta}_0 + \tilde{\beta}_2 \delta_0 + \tilde{\beta}_1 x_1 + \tilde{\beta}_2 \delta_1 x_1 + \tilde{\beta}_2 v + \tilde{u}$$`
`$$y = \tilde{\tilde{\beta}}_0 + (\tilde{\beta}_1 + \tilde{\beta}_2 \delta_1 ) x_1 + \tilde{v}$$`

---
class: MSU
# Multivariate regression

### Therefore it is true that:
- `\(\hat{\beta}_1 = \hat{\tilde{\beta}}_1 + \hat{\tilde{\beta}}_2 \hat{\delta}_1\)`
  - In words: to whatever extent `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_2\)` are correlated ( `\(\delta_1\)` ), our naive `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` will include that correlation. 

### Knowing this, when would the simple regression estimate `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` **equal** the multiple regression (multivariate) estimate `\(\hat{\tilde{\beta}}_1\)`?

--

When `\(\delta_1 = 0\)`

--

When `\(\tilde{\beta}_2 = 0\)`

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Using the coefficients from the previous slide, we see it works:

`$$60.21 = 76.22 + (\underbrace{17.64}_{\hat{\tilde{\beta}}_2} \times \underbrace{-.91}_{\hat{\delta}_1})$$`

# Multivariate regression

To summarize:
- Leaving a variable out can bias our estimate of `\(\beta_1\)`
- We need to account for the variation in `\(x_1\)` explained by `\(x_2\)`
- We can do this by partialling out `\(x_2\)` from `\(x_1\)`
- The result will change our estimate of `\(\beta_1\)`
- We can even sign and calculate the bias

Goodness of fit and Specification Errors

### [top](#Overview)

class: MSU
# Goodness of fit

## We can still use the same formula for R^2

`$$R^2 = \frac{SSE}{SST} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - \hat{\bar{y}})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \bar{y})^2}$$`
This is because `\(R^2\)` only uses the fit of the whole model, determined by how well `\(\hat{y}\)` fits.

--

### When we add one more variable to our model
- The denominator doesn't change (SST doesn't change)
- The numerator, though, gets weakly larger (SSE increases and SSR decreases)
- Intuitively, SSR decreases because more variables can only provide more explanatory power. `\(\hat{u}_i\)` can only get smaller with more variables. If it didn't, the Least Squares estimate would be to set the new variable's `\(\beta = 0\)`.
  - `\(\Rightarrow\)` R^2 never gets smaller when variables are added.

---
class: MSU
# Three or more variables

## Multiple regression is easily extended to many variables.

`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k + u$$`

And multiple variables, we can extend the partialing out in the following manner:
- `\(x_1 = \delta_0 + \beta_1 x_2 + \beta_2 x_3 + \cdots + \beta_k x_{k+1} + v\)`
  - `\(v\)` is the part of `\(x_1\)` that has had `\(x_2, x_3, \cdots\)` partialed out
- `\(y = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{v}\)`
- `\(\beta_1\)` = `\(\alpha_1\)`

You can "partial out" multiple variables, leaving only variation that is uncorrelated with the other variables.

## OLS is easily extended from 2 to &gt;2 variables

---
class: MSU
# Specification errors

## We might be worried about two *specification errors*
- Including an irrelevant variable.
  - Suppose the "true model" is:
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + u$$`
  - And we estimate:
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + u$$`
  - Then OLS is still an unbiased estimator, since *unbaisedness* holds regardless of the true value of the parameters, even if `\(\beta_j = 0\)` for some `\(j\)`.
  - Including an irrelevant variable will, however, impact the variance of the OLS estimator.

---
class: MSU
# Specification errors
## We might be worried about two *specification errors*

- Omitting a relevant variable.
`$$y = \tilde{\beta}_0 + \tilde{\beta}_1 x_1 + u$$`

  - We showed that `\(\tilde{\beta}_1 = \beta_1\)` only when `\(\beta_2 = 0\)` or `\(\delta_1 = 0\)`.
  - Size and direction depend on the sign and size of `\(\beta_2 \delta_1\)`, which depends on the relationship of the omitted variable and the included variable, `\(x_1\)`, and the outcome variable, `\(y\)`.
  - With multiple regressors, the sign and size may not be clear.
  - We can usually *"sign the bias"* if we
      1. have an idea of what is omitted, 
      2. have an idea of how it's correlated with `\(y\)`, and 
      3. have an idea of how it's correlated with one or more of `\(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k\)`

`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{v} + \beta_2 \hat{w} + u$$`

### Where:

`$$x_1 = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_2 + v$$`
.center[and]

`$$\hat{v} = x_1 - \hat{\delta}_0 - \hat{\delta}_1 x_2$$`

### What if we want to do inference?

We need to know the variance of the estimator, `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_2\)`.

# Variance of the estimator


### Recall Gauss-Markov Assumptions for **single** variable `\(x\)`

SLR.1: In the population, `\(y\)` is a linear function of the parameters, `\(x\)`, and `\(u\)`: `\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x+u\)`

SLR.2: the sample `\((y_i, x_i): i= 1, 2, \cdots, n\)` follows the population model and are independent.

SLR.3: "Sample Variation in the Explanatory ( `\(X\)` ) Variable". That is, `\(x_i\)` is not the same for all `\(i\)`'s.

SLR.4: "Zero conditional mean". `\(E[u|x] = 0\)`

SLR.1-SLR.4 `\(\Rightarrow \hat{\beta}\)` is .orange[unbiased estimate] of `\(\beta\)`.

--

SLR.5: `\(Var[u|x] = \sigma^2_u\)` for all `\(x\)`. (*homoskedasticity*)

`\(\Rightarrow Var(\hat{\beta}) = \frac{\sigma^2_u}{SST_x}\)`


---
class: MSU
# Last time (or earlier)

### `\(Var(\hat{\beta})\)` for single-variable regression:
We formulated `\(\beta\)` up to this point earlier:
`$$\hat{\beta}_1 = \beta_1 + \frac{\sum((x_i - \bar{x})u_i)}{SST_x}$$`
And then took the variance of this, noting that `\(Var(\beta_1)=0\)` because it is a (constant) population parameter.

`$$\begin{equation}
Var(\hat{\beta_1}) = \frac{1}{SST_x^2} \times Var\left[\sum(x_i - \bar{x}) u_i\right] = \frac{SST_x}{SST_x^2} \sigma^2_u = \frac{1}{SST_x}\sigma^2_u
\end{equation}$$`

---
class: MSU
# Last time (or earlier)

### And we could estimate `\(\sigma^2_u\)`:
`$$\hat{\sigma}_u^2 = \frac{1}{(N-2)} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \hat{u}_i^2 = \frac{SSR}{N-2}$$`

The `\(N-2\)` is because we lost two *degrees of freedom* due to the two restrictions:
- `\(\sum \hat{u} = 0\)`
- `\(\sum \hat{u}_i x_i = 0\)`


---
class: MSU
# Variance of the estimator

###Let's start by looking at `\(\sigma^2_u\)`

### In multiple regression, we have more restrictions:
- `\(\sum \hat{u} = 0\)`
- `\(\sum \hat{u}_i x_{i,1} = 0\)`
- `\(\sum \hat{u}_i x_{i,2} = 0\)`
- `\(\sum \hat{u}_i x_{i,\cdots} = 0\)`

One for each `\(\beta\)`. So, when we have `\(\{\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2 \}\)`, we lose 3 degrees of freedom:
`$$\hat{\sigma}_u^2 = \frac{1}{(N-3)} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \hat{u}_i^2 = \frac{SSR}{N-3}$$`
---
class: MSU
# Variance of the estimator

### Generalizing to `\(K\)` variables
- We always count 1 for `\(\beta_0\)`&lt;br&gt;
- We call the number of `\(X\)`'s `\(K\)`&lt;br&gt;
- We would use `\(\frac{1}{N-K-1}\)` if there are `\(K\)` `\(x\)`'s.&lt;br&gt;
- `\(N\)` is the number of observations in our regression. &lt;br&gt;

If `\(\hat{\beta} = \{\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2\}\)`
- Then we have `\(N-2-1 = N-3\)` degrees of freedom

If `\(\hat{\beta} = \{\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2, \hat{\beta}_3\}\)`
- Then we have `\(N-3-1 = N-4\)` degrees of freedom

---
class: MSU
# Variance of the estimator

Since

`$$\widehat{Var}(\hat{\beta}) = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_u}{SST_x}$$`
and

`$$\hat{\sigma}^2_u = \frac{SSR}{N-K-1}$$`

### More `\(X\)`'s (more regressors) means the denominator on `\(\hat{\sigma}^2_u\)` gets smaller
`\(\Rightarrow \hat{\sigma}^2_u\)` gets **larger**

`\(\Rightarrow \widehat{Var}(\hat{\beta})\)` gets **larger**

And thus .orange[our confidence intervals get larger, rejection region gets smaller, and we lose *precision*]


---
class: MSU
# Variance of the estimator

### So we know how to calculate our multivariate `\(\hat{\sigma}^2_u\)`. 

### What about the rest of `\(\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_u}{SST_x}\)`? What is `\(SST_x\)`?
- Before, we had one `\(x\)`, so `\(SST_x\)` was straightforward.
- Now, we have 2 or more `\(x\)`'s.

### Each `\(x\)` has its own `\(SST_x\)`:
`$$SST_{x_k} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_k)^2$$`
Note that we are summing the `\(x_k\)` over all `\(i\)`.

The data:

&lt;table class="table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:center;"&gt; x1 &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:center;"&gt; x2 &lt;/th&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
`\(\bar{x}_1 = 4\)`
&lt;br&gt;
`\(\bar{x}_2 = 0\)`

]

Which results in `\(SST_x\)`'s of:

`\(SST_{x_1}\)` = 14
&lt;br&gt;
`\(SST_{x_2}\)` = 8

# Variance of the estimator

### We need to make one more adjustment
We need to account for how unique the variance in each of the `\(x_k\)`'s is.
- Imagine if we had two `\(x\)`'s: `\(x_j, x_k\)`, but they were *almost* always the same number. 
  - Think: temperature and rainfall.
- The estimates of the corresponding `\(\beta\)`'s: `\(\beta_j\)` and `\(\beta_k\)`, should have a lot of variance to them because we aren't sure which is *actually* explaining the variation in `\(y\)`.

### So, we are going to weight each `\(SST_{x_j}\)` by `\((1-R^2_j)\)`
Where `\(R^2_j\)` is the `\(R^2\)` of the regression `\(x_j = \delta_0 + \delta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \delta_k x_k + v\)`. 
--


That is, we will weight it by "how well is this variable, `\(x_j\)`, explained by all the other variables"

---
class: MSU
# Variance of the estimator

### So with that weighted `\(SST_{x_j}\)`, `\(Var(\beta_j)\)` is:
`$$Var(\hat{\beta}_j) = \frac{\sigma^2_u}{SST_{x_j} (1-R^2_j)}$$`
And we can estimate this easily:
`$$\widehat{Var}(\hat{\beta}_j) = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_u}{SST_{x_j} (1-\hat{R}^2_j)}$$`

---
class: MSU
# Variance of the estimator

### When `\(R^2_j\)` is high:
- Then `\(x_j\)` is explained almost completely by `\(x_1, \cdots, x_k\)` (the other `\(x\)`'s)
--

- `\(R^2_j\)` is very high
--

- `\((1-R^2_j)\)` is very small, close to 0
--

- `\(SST_{x_j}(1-R^2_j)\)` is very small, close to 0
--

- And thus, `\(Var(\hat{\beta}_j) = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_u}{SST_{x_j}(1-R^2_j)}\)` is **very high** when `\(R^2_j\)` is very high. 
  - It is division by a small number near 0

# Distribution of the estimator

### Gauss-Markov Regression Assumptions: 

| | |
|:---:|:---|
|MLR.1| The population, `\(y\)` is a linear function of the parameters `\(x\)` and `\(u\)`: `\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k + u\)` |
|MLR.2| The sample `\((y_i, x_i): i = 1,2,\cdots,n\)` follows the population model and are independent |
|MLR.3| No multicolinearity / "full rank": `\(x_j\)` is not a linear transformation of `\(x_k\)` for all `\(j,k\)`. |
|MLR.4| Zero conditional mean: `\(E[u \vert x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_k] = 0\)` for all `\(x\)`. |

### A neat thing happens when assumptions 1-5 hold
## OLS is .DUKEblue[B.L.U.E.]

- **B**est
  - Has the lowest variance

- **L**inear
  - `\(\beta\)` is a linear function of the data

- **U**nbiased
  - Is unbiased (showed for single; holds for multiple)

- **E**stimator

### Of all linear, unbiased estimators, OLS is the most efficient


---
class: MSU
# Distribution of the estimator

### Remember what we needed for inference

- `\(E[\hat{\beta}]=\beta\)`

- `\(Var(\hat{\beta})\)`

- That `\(\hat{\beta} \sim N(\beta, Var(\hat{\beta}))\)`

--

How do we know it's Normal?
- We will need more assumptions

  - Chapter 5 has weaker assumptions with a similar result

---
class: MSU
# Distribution of the estimator

### Assumption MLR.6: Normality of `\(u\)`
We can assume a normal distribution for the OLS estimator, `\(\hat{\beta}\)`, by assuming that the errors, `\(u\)`, are normally distributed in the population.

### Assume:
$$ u|x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k \sim N(0, \sigma^2_u)$$

### Then:
`$$y|x_1, \cdots, x_k \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k, \sigma^2_u)$$`

Note that this is the distribution of `\(y\)` conditional on the `\(x\)`'s. .orange[All of the random variation comes from] `\(u\)`. `\(x\)`'s conditionally shift the mean .orange[deterministically].

--

I'm adding the subscript `\(u\)` to `\(\sigma^2_u\)` for emphasis, but since `\(u\)` is the only source of random variation once we condition on `\(x\)`'s, it is implied to be the only `\(\sigma^2\)`.

---
class: MSU
# Distribution of the estimator

### How do we get from normal `\(u\)`'s to normal `\(\beta\)`?

Define `\(\hat{v}_j\)` to be the residual of a regression of `\(x_j\)` on all other `\(x\)`'s. In a two variable `\((x_j, x_k)\)` example for observation `\(i\)`:
`$$x_{i,j} = \hat{\delta}_{0} + \hat{\delta}_1 x_{i,k} + \hat{v}_{i,j}$$`

### Then `\(\hat{\beta}_j\)` is:
`$$\hat{\beta}_j = \frac{\widehat{Cov}(\hat{v},y)}{\widehat{Var}(\hat{v})} =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{v}_{ij} y_i}{\sum_{s=1}^n \hat{v}^2_{sj}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{ij}u_i$$`
### Where:
`$$w_{ij} = \frac{\hat{v}_{ij}}{\sum_{s=1}^n \hat{v}^2_{sj}}$$`

### Thus, `\(\hat{\beta}_j\)` is a linear combination of normals!

---
class: MSU
# Distribution of the estimator

### And a linear combination of normals is....normal!
(See Stats Review notes. Told you that property would come in handy).

### So now we know :
- `\(E[\hat{\beta}]\)`
- `\(Var(\hat{\beta})\)`
- That `\(\hat{\beta}\)` really is normally distributed

### That's what we need to start testing things!

`$$\frac{\hat{\beta} - \beta}{se(\hat{\beta})} \sim N(0,1) \quad\text{and}\quad  \frac{\hat{\beta} - \beta}{\hat{se}(\hat{\beta})} \sim t_{N-K-1}$$`

# Heteroskedasticity

### In practice, we have a very useful method of "correcting" for heteroskedasticity called "robust standard errors"
- Eicker-Huber-White Heteroskedasticity-Consistent (HC) errors (1980)

### In R, we can compute these errors fairly easily
We'll see in a few slides.
    

It comes at a cost, though: it inflates errors (make larger)
- Less likely to be "significant" (reject `\(H_0\)`) even if there is evidence to reject `\(H_0\)`.
- That's what it's supposed to do **if** there is heteroskedasticity
- But if there **isn't** heteroskedasticity, you are wasting some power.


---
class: MSU
# Heteroskedasticity

## Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors: how do they work?

The problem is that `\(x_j\)` may be correlated with `\(u\)` and thus `\(\sigma^2_m \neq \sigma^2_n\)` - there is no common, single `\(\sigma^2\)`. 

In the **single variable regression case**, we would account for this:
`$$\widehat{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \hat{u}_i^2}{(SST_x)^2}$$`

Note that we have squared the sum-of-squares total in the denominator. The numerator looks a little like covariance, but it's more like the covariance of .orange[squared] terms.

---
class: MSU
# Heteroskedasticity

### In multiple regression, things get complicated:
`$$\hat{Var}(\hat{\beta}_j) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{v}^2_{ij} \hat{u}_i^2}{(SSR_j)^2}$$`

Which looks like the multivariate variance error, but with the extra `\(SSR_j\)` in the denominator, and `\(\hat{v}\)`, the residual from `\(x_j\)` on `\(x_i\)`


---
class: MSU
# Heteroskedasticity

### If we adjust with heteroskedasticity-consistent errors (HC)
then we can relax MLR.5 and still have a *valid* estimate of the variance of `\(\hat{\beta}\)`.

### Note that **heteroskedasticity-consistent errors** do not **ever** affect the point estimate of `\(\hat{\beta}\)`. 
- The point estimates remain the same, but the error (and thus the significance) changes.
  - "Point estimate" refers to the value of `\(\hat{\beta}\)`, regardless of the variance.

# Heteroskedasticity

### There are two meanings of the word "robust" in econometrics

- Robust standard errors, which is what we are discussing here

- A "robust" regression is one that is not affected by a particular specification issue
  - When we saw that we could include unrelated `\(x\)`'s and not worry about getting bias, our regression was "robust"

Testing Multiple `\(\beta\)`'s


### [top](#Overview)

class: MSU
# Testing multiple betas

### In economics, we sometimes want to test
- `\(H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2\)`
- `\(H_A: \beta_1 &gt; \beta_2\)`
  - A one-tailed test
  
Let's look at how we can set this up using the hypothesis testing tools we have:
- `\(H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2\)` is the same as `\(H_0: \beta_1 - \beta_2 = 0\)`
- `\(H_A: \beta_1 - \beta_2&gt;0\)` follows. 

Super - if we have `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_2\)`, all we need is the `\(se(\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_2)\)`.
- This is **not, I repeat NOT** `\(se(\hat{\beta}_1) - se(\hat{\beta}_2)\)`.

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple betas

### The formula for the variance of the sum of two random variables
`$$Var(\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_2) = Var(\hat{\beta}_1) + Var(\hat{\beta}_2) - 2 Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)$$`
And the `\(se\)` is the square root of the variance.

### We have not been given the `\(Cov(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2)\)`
- It is calculated by R in the variance-covariance matrix
- We won't worry about how. Just know that it is possible

### R can be asked to generate that `\(t\)`-statistic and test it
.pseudocode[vcov(myOLS)]

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple betas

The example in Wooldridge, Section 4-4:
`$$log(wage) = \beta_0 + \beta_{jc} jc + \beta_{univ} univ + \beta_{exper} exper$$`

We'd like to test to see if *years in junior college, jc* have the same effect on log-wages as *years in university*, controlling for experience (ceteris paribus!)

We'd like to test `\(\beta_{jc} = \beta_{univ}\)`, which is:
- `\(H_0: \beta_{jc} - \beta_{univ} = 0\)`
- `\(H_A: \beta_{jc} - \beta_{univ} \neq 0\)`

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple betas

Sure, we **could** rewrite the equation so that we get a coefficient that is equivalent to `\(\beta_{jc} - \beta_{univ}\)`:
`$$log(wage) = \beta_0 + \beta_{jc} jc + \beta_{totcollege} (univ+jc) + \beta_{exper} exper$$`

Since `\(\beta_{totcollege}\)` captures both JC and University, `\(\beta_{jc}\)` captures the difference between the two - exactly what we want to test! The `\(t\)`-stat for that coefficient is our test.

But we could do it with a **linear hypothesis test**

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple betas

Of course, R does it for us as well without re-writing the equation:

    library(car)
    myOLS = lm(wage ~ jc + univ + exper, df)
    linearHypothesis(model = myOLS, hypothesis.matrix = "jc - univ = 0" )
    
This tests if the coefficient `\(\beta_{jc}\)` is the same as `\(\beta_{univ}\)`.
- That is, it tests if the effect of `\(jc\)` is the same as the effect of `\(univ\)`
- It does so by calculating the `\(\hat{se}(\hat{\beta}_{jc} - \hat{\beta}_{univ})\)`

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple betas


```r
NN = 400
df1 = data.frame(jc = rpois(2, NN),
                 univ = rpois(4, NN),
                 u = rnorm(NN, mean=0, sd = 5)) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(wage = 10 + 2.5*jc + 2.5*univ + u)

myOLS&lt;-lm(wage ~ jc + univ, df1)
linearHypothesis(model = myOLS, hypothesis.matrix = 'jc - univ = 0')
```

```

## jc - univ = 0

Here, I create fake data where I know there are equal effects, and I test `\(H_0: \beta_{jc} = \beta_{univ}\)`. We fail to reject ( `\(p&gt;.05\)` )

Testing multiple restrictions

# Testing multiple restrictions

### But what if we want to know if more than one coefficient is zero?
- Let's say we have run .pseudocode[lm(khomeprice ~ bedrooms + bathrooms + sqft, df)]

- And we want to know if `\(\beta_{bedrooms}=\beta_{bathrooms}=0\)`.
  - Are all of these coefficients *jointly* zero?
    - Once we account for `\(sqft\)`, which is not being tested
  - Is the effect of `\(bedrooms\)` **and** `\(bathrooms\)` zero **all together**.



---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions


### This differs from asking about each of the separately
- It might be that each one has no statistically significant effect, but taken together, they might jointly have some effect.
- It is also asking if these coefficients, together, explain much of `\(y\)`.

### This is a *multiple linear restriction* test (W. 4.5)

We can do this in R with .pseudocode[linearHypothesis] as well.

We *fail to reject* the null hypothesis that both `\(\beta_{bedrooms}\)` and `\(\beta_{bathrooms}=0\)` jointly.

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

`\(H_0: \beta_{bedrooms}=\beta_{bathrooms}=0\)`

`\(H_A: H_0\)` is not true

Rejecting the null hypothesis doesn't tell us which "part" of the hypothesis rejects.
- It doesn't say that bedrooms isn't zero,
- Or that bathrooms isn't zero.

### We can think of these joint tests as *restrictions* - we are asking .orange["do these coefficients, jointly, explain any of y?"]

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

### Testing if a group of coefficients all *jointly* equal zero is a special situation
Saying that `\(\beta_1, \beta_2\)` are jointly zero is the same as saying that `\(\beta_1, \beta_2\)` do not explain any variation in `\(y\)`.
- If they don't explain any variation in `\(y\)` (jointly), then *they can be left out of the model*.
- Testing if they are jointly zero is the same as testing if you can leave them out of the regression entirely.

### So how would we test this?
---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

### Testing these "restrictions"

### First, we run the *unrestricted* model:
.pseudocode[lm(khomeprice ~ bedrooms + bathrooms + sqft, df)]

Then, we take the `\(SSR\)`, the Sum of Squared Residuals
- `\(\sum \hat{u}^2\)`. Call it `\(SSR_{UR}\)`
- The unrestricted (UR) model also has degrees of freedom `\(N-K-1 = N-4-1\)`

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions


### Then, we run the *restricted* model:
.pseudocode[lm(khomeprice ~ sqft, df)]

- .orange[This is "restricted" because we are making a restrictive statement about] `\(\beta_{bedrooms}, \beta_{bathrooms}\)`
- Specifically, we are saying **that they are equal to zero** in this model!
  - Doesn't get much more restrictive than that, does it?
- The restricted (R) model also has degrees of freedom `\(N-K-1 = N-1-1\)`.


---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

### We can compare the `\(SSR\)` of each model.
"Do the increased number of parameters (2) explain enough variance (reduce the variance of `\(u\)`) sufficiently to include them?"

### What should our test do?
- If `\(SSR_{R} - SSR_{UR}\)` is very big, then the unrestricted model (more `\(\beta\)`'s) is more "explanatory", and that **set** of `\(\beta\)`'s are not, jointly, zero. 
  - Our test should reject the null that `\(\beta_{bedrooms}=\beta_{bathrooms}=0\)`
- It should account for the difference in degrees of freedom

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

### Here's our test statistic, `\(F\)`:
`$$F = \frac{\frac{(SSR_{R} - SSR_{UR})}{q}}{\frac{SSR_{UR}}{N-K_{UR}-1}}$$`
Where `\(q\)` is the **number of restrictions we are testing**. Here, it is `\(2\)`. 
- Because we are testing `\(\beta_{bedrooms}=\beta_{bathrooms}=0\)`
- q = `\(df_{R} - df_{UR}\)`

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

### Here's our test statistic, `\(F\)`:
`$$F = \frac{\frac{(SSR_{R} - SSR_{UR})}{q}}{\frac{SSR_{UR}}{N-K_{UR}-1}}$$`

### F has a known distribution:

If you recall (you probably don't), we introduced an `\(F\)`-distribution back in stats review.

`\(F\)` is like `\(t\)` - it is defined only by its degrees of freedom.

`\(F\)`, unlike `\(t\)`, takes *two* degrees of freedom: the numerator `\((q)\)`and the denominator `\((N-K_{UR}-1)\)`.
- `\(F\sim F_{q,N-K_{UR}-1}\)`

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

&lt;img src="img/Figure 4-7.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

This is the `\(F_{3,60}\)` distribution from Wooldridge Fig 4-7. 
- The rejection region is always only on the right ( `\(SSR_{R} - SSR_{UR} &gt; 0\)` always)
- When `\(SSR_R\)` is big relative to `\(SSR_{UR}\)` (the `\(\beta\)`'s being tested explain a lot, making `\(\hat{u}^2\)` smaller), the F-stat is larger
  - Which means it is further out to the right, closer or in the rejection region.
  
---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

If `\(F\)` is big, it is more likely to be in the rejection region

When `\(F\)` is in the rejection region, we reject the `\(H_0: \beta_{x_1}=\beta_{x_2}=\beta_{x_3}=0\)`

When we reject `\(H_0\)`, all of these are true:
- Jointly, the coefficients are not all zero
- **The unrestricted model (the one with all coefficients in it) is a better model**
- It has sufficiently better explanatory power to justify the extra coefficients.

---
class: MSU
# Testing multiple restrictions

### R automatically gives us an F-stat
It is the `\(F\)` test where the restriction is that all `\(\beta\)`'s except the constant are 0
- Which is saying "does this model, with .orange[all] it's coefficients and RHS variable `\(x\)`'s, explain `\(y\)` any better than just using `\(\beta_0\)`.
--

- A model with only `\(\beta_0\)` is equivalent to just guessing `\(\bar{y}\)`, and not using *any* of the `\(x\)`'s.
- So the `\(F\)` test that R outputs is a test for whether or not all the coefficients (except the intercept, `\(\beta_0\)`) are zero.

- How to test a joint hypothesis about multiple coefficients
- How to test if many coefficients are jointly zero
- What the `\(F\)` test R gives us is testing:
  - Whether or not all the coefficients, jointly, are zero
  - Which is the same as saying whether or not all the coefficients, jointly, explain `\(y\)` any better than just using `\(\beta_0\)`

Testing for heteroskedasticity



### [top](#Overview)



---
class: MSU
# Testing for Heteroskedasticity

### How do we know for sure
that we should be concerned about heteroskedasticity?

### Like the `\(F\)` test for whether or not some coefficients are jointly zero, we have a test for heteroskedasticity.
We can use it to see if we need to apply our Heteroskedasticity-consistent errors (HC)

The test follows from the notion that `\(\sigma^2_u\)` might increase **with one of our** `\(X\)`'s.

---
class: MSU
# Testing for Heteroskedasticity

### Breusch-Pagan Test for Heteroskedasticity

1. Estimate our model `\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + u\)`

2. Calculate `\(\hat{u}\)` and `\(\hat{u}^2\)`. 

3. Regress `\(\hat{u}^2 = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 x_1 + \gamma_2 x_2 + v\)`

4. Check the p-value of the `\(F\)` statistic from this test. 
  - If it is small, we reject the `\(H_0\)`
  - The `\(H_0\)` is homoskedasticity
  - So rejecting `\(\rightarrow\)` we have heteroskedasticity and should use HC (robust) errors
  
  
### This works because we are doing a joint test for whether or not `\(x_1, \cdots, x_2\)` explain (jointly) the magnitude (variance) of `\(\hat{u}\)`.

Asymptotic normality and consistency


### [top](#Overview)

class: MSU
# Asymptotic Normality

### Gauss-Markov Regression Assumptions: 

| | |
|:---:|:---|
|MLR.1| The population, `\(y\)` is a linear function of the parameters `\(x\)` and `\(u\)`: `\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k + u\)` |
|MLR.2| The sample `\((y_i, x_i): i = 1,2,\cdots,n\)` follows the population model and are independent |
|MLR.3| No multicolinearity / "full rank": `\(x_j\)` is not a linear transformation of `\(x_k\)` for all `\(j,k\)`. |
|MLR.4| Zero conditional mean: `\(E[u \vert x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_k] = 0\)` for all `\(x\)`. |
|MLR.5| `\(Var[u \vert x_1, \cdots, x_k]= \sigma^2_u\)` for all `\(x\)`. |  
|MLR.6| `\(u\)` is normally distributed ( `\(u \sim N\)` ) |

---
class: MSU
# Asymptotic Normality

### If we combine MLR.6 with MLR.4 and MLR.5, we are assuming "exact normality"

### Exact Normality:
- The population error `\(u\)` is *mean independent* of the explanatory variables `\(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k\)`
- And it is normally distributed with zero mean and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`: `\(u\sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)`
  - Let's call this "exact normality"
  - We need this *only* for inference (t's, F-tests)

### Mean Independence:
"Mean independence" is `\(E[u|x_1, \cdots, x_k] = c\)` and `\(E[u] = 0\)` (therefore `\(c=0\)`)

---
class: MSU
# Asymptotic Normality

### "Asymptotic" just means "pertaining to very large N's"
- That is, very large samples.
--

### The "asymptotic properties" of an estimator are:
- "What it does when `\(N\rightarrow \infty\)`"
  - When "N gets larger and larger"
- Particularly, does it get *closer and closer* to some desirable value?
--

### MLR6, the "exact normality" assumption, may not be necessary with a very large `\(N\)`
- Which is good, because it probably doesn't hold in many cases!

--

Let's look at one where exact normality doesn't hold

---
class: MSU
# Asymptotic Normality

### Example 3.5 in Wooldridge
`$$NumArrests = \beta_0 + \beta_1 pcnv + \beta_2 avgsentence + \beta_3 ptime + \beta_4 qemp + u$$`

Example 3.5 in Wooldridge discusses regressing *Number times arrested* on some variables of interest. Since most people are arrested zero times, `\(y|x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k\)` and the associated errors, `\(u|x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k\)` are most definitely not normally distributed!

So, the estimators are still:

--

- Unbiased (MLR1-4)

--

- Have valid variances (MLR5 or HC-robust)

--

- But we do not know the exact distribution to use: `\(u\)` is not necessarily normal, so `\(\beta\)` is not necessarily normally distributed. Therefore, our `\(t\)`-test is not valid.


---
class: MSU
# Asymptotic Normality

### The Central Limit Theorem to the rescue

The CLT states that any average, once standardized, is distributed standard normal when `\(n\)` gets very large.

--

- By **average**, we mean anything that is the form `\(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i\)`

--

- By **standardized**, we mean anything that subtracts the true mean and divides by the standard deviation
- We used this fact in looking at the *se of the mean*: 
`$$\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_Y}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim N(0,1)$$`



---
class: MSU
# Asymptotic Normality

### `\(\hat{\beta}\)` is also an average
- `\(\widehat{Cov}(Y,X)\)` is an average: `\(\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})\)`
- `\(\widehat{Var}(X)\)` is also an average just the same
  - `\(\beta\)` depends on a bunch of averages!

### So if we *properly standardize* it, we know it is asymptotically normal *regardless* of the distribution of `\(u\)`
- This is true even if `\(u\)` is very obviously not normal.

--

### This only applies as `\(n \rightarrow \infty\)`. It is an asymptotic result

---
class: MSU
# Asymptotic normality

### Even when MLR.6 doesn't hold
We can say that our estimator, `\(\beta\)`, has a normal **asymptotic variance**

Which means it is normally distributed **when `\(n \rightarrow \infty\)`**.
- Asymptotic standard error
- Asymptotic 95% Confidence Interval, etc.

And, since a `\(t_{\infty - K - 1}\)` is the same as a `\(N(0,1)\)`, we can use the normal tables instead of the t-tables.

When `\(n\)` is small and `\(u\)` is not normal, then we use "small sample" properties, which we won't cover in this class.

---
class: MSU
# Consistency


### Consistency is a property of an estimat**or**, much like "unbiased"
- It is about what happens to the estimator when `\(n\)` gets larger and larger. 
- On the other hand, *bias* is about the expected value of the estimator.

### Definition
&gt; An estimator is consistent when it converges in probability to the correct population value as the sample size grows.

#### Converges in probability
For any tiny, tiny number we can choose, say `\(\epsilon\)`, a consistent estimator `\(\hat{\beta}\)` will have some `\(n\)` large enough that `\(Pr(|\hat{\beta} - \beta| &gt; \epsilon) \rightarrow 0\)` as `\(n \rightarrow \infty\)`

---
class: MSU
# Consistency

### Remember our *standard error of the mean*
`$$se(\bar{X}) = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sigma^2}{n}}$$`

If we had a small `\(n\)`
- We had a pretty big std. err on `\(\bar{X}\)`

But if we had a really big `\(n\)`
- We got a std. error that was smaller and smaller...
--


With a big enough `\(n\)`, the std. error of the mean becomes very very small
- And a plot looks like a "spike"

### **That's the concept of consistent**


---
class: MSU
# Consistency

A good example of *biased* but *consistent* is the use of the population variation formula on a sample:
`$$\hat{\sigma}^2_{biased} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$`

Biased, yes. But *consistent* since the estimate goes to the correct value as `\(n\rightarrow \infty\)`

.footnote[The proof showing why the 1/N calculation is biased is long and drawn-out. Just remember that 1/N is biased.]

### The end result is that we can relax MLR6 in large samples and not worry about `\(u\)` being normally distributed and **still:**
- Know that `\(\hat{\beta}\)` is normally distributed
- Know that we can use a `\(t\)`-statistic (since we are still estimating `\(\hat{\sigma^2}\)`)
- And know that since `\(\hat{\sigma}^2\)` is consistent, with large samples, `\(\frac{\hat{\beta}-\beta}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{SST_x}}} \sim N(0,1)\)`

Dummy variables




### [top](#Overview)

class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

### A dummy is any variable that takes **only** one of two values:

`$$\{0,1\}$$`

- This is also called a **binary** variable

### Sometimes called an "indicator variable" as well
- Because it "indicates" if something *qualitative* is true.
- Also, sometimes written as `\(\mathbb{1}(condition)\)` e.g. `\(1(age&gt;65)\)`
  - It is equal to 1 for that observation if that observation's age is greater than 65.
  - It is equal to 0 otherwise
  
### In Wooldridge Ch. 7.1
- He uses the example of `\(male\)` and `\(female\)`, with a variable equal to `\(1\)` if `\(female==TRUE\)`.

---
class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

### Since it takes on numeric values, we can use it in a regression:
`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + \delta_0 1(female) + u$$`
- Sometimes, it will just say that " `\(x_2\)` is a binary indicator variable that takes on the value of 1 if..."
- In Wooldridge, it just says `\(y = \beta_0 + \delta_0 female + \cdots + u\)`
  - You are left to infer that `\(female\)` is either `\(\{0,1\}\)`.
- There are other ways that a dummy variable may be indicated as well, but almost all authors will describe when a dummy/binary/indicator is being used.
--

- The "dummy' allows `\(y\)` to vary by one discrete amount ( `\(\delta_0\)` here) when the condition is true.

--

Clearly, the indicator must refer to something observable in the data
- They aren't magical!

---
class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

### The "separate intercept" interpretation
Wooldridge frames the coefficient on the binary variable as **intercept shift** between females and males.

&lt;img src="img/Figure 7-1.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
For males, the intercept is `\(\beta_0\)`. For females, `\(\beta_0 + \delta_0\)` (here `\(\delta_0 &lt; 0\)`).



---
class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

### Since a binary variable is always either `\(\{0,1\}\)`, it always shifts by one constant amount
- Just like the Wooldridge Fig 7-1

### It doesn't alter the *slope* of the line directly, but it *can* account for variation (higher average wages for men) that then allows the slope to be better estimated
- So the slope may be different with the dummy included:
`$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + u$$`
and

`$$wage = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 1(female) + \alpha_2 educ + u$$`
will not result in `\(\beta_1=\alpha_2\)`. They will be different estimates.

# Dummy Variables

### Dummy Variables *with* continuous variables

`$$OutOfPocket = \beta_0 + \beta_1 1(age&gt;65) + \beta_2 cigarettes + u$$`
Here, `\(OutOfPocket\)` is the annual dollars spent out of pocket on healthcare.
- We think it is affected by number of cigarettes smoked
- We think it might be affected by age

### So why not just use the variable itself?
- Why a dummy `\(1(age&gt;65)\)` and not just `\(age\)` as a RHS `\(x\)`?
---
class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

### So why not just use the variable itself?
- Why a dummy `\(1(age&gt;65)\)` and not just `\(age\)` as a RHS `\(x\)`?


- First, we may not want to impose that constant marginal effect - sure, we could have `\(\beta_{age}\)`, but it means we'd be assuming the same effect of age from 10 years old to 11 years old as we do from 64 years old to 65!
--
&lt;br&gt;
- Second, there may be a "threshold" we're interested in
  - For example, Medicare starts at 65 years old.
  - Then being over 65 (and being on Medicare) would have an important effect to account for.
  - And we certainly wouldn't want age alone to try to explain it!

class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

In fact, we could include `\(age\)` and the dummy variable:
`$$OutOfPocket =\beta_0 + \beta_1 1(age&gt;65) + \beta_2 age + \beta_3 cigarettes + u$$`

### Here's what that data would look like:

.pull-left[

|7782|48|0|
|8136|63|0|
|9730|86|1|
|7928|66|1|
|...|...|...|
]

.pull-right[
As you can see, `\(Over65\)` is fully determined by `\(age\)`, but that's OK. They will not be perfectly correlated (correlation is a linear concept).

Let's see how this compares to
- Just using age
- Just using the dummy
- Both

### One interpretation of `\(\beta_0\)` is "the expected value of `\(y\)` when `\(x=0\)`"
- I'm going add `\(cigarettes\)` back in here:

`$$OutOfPocket = \beta_0 + \beta_1 1(age&gt;65) + \beta_2 cigarettes + u$$`

- When does `\(x=0\)` here?

- So, what is the `\(E[Y|age&lt;65, cigarettes==0]\)`?

- What is the `\(E[Y|age&gt;65, cigarettes==0]\)`?

Compare that to the first regression with only a dummy for `\(1(age&lt;65)\)`

class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

### Interpretation of Dummy Variables

#### The dummy variable has a "base" level that is *included in* `\(\beta_0\)`
- And the coefficient on the dummy **is the difference between the base level and the "dummy is true" level**
  - This is because `\(\beta_0 = E[Y|X=0]\)` for all `\(X\)`
  
--

- If there are two dummies, `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_2\)`:
  - `\(\beta_0\)` is the `\(E[Y|x_1=0, x_2 = 0]\)`
  - That is, it is the value when both are "false"
  - And `\(\beta_1\)` is the relative value if **only** `\(x_1\)` were true, **ceteris paribus**
  - Same for `\(\beta_2\)`, **ceteris paribus**
--

- It does *not* tell us anything about `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_2\)` being true together, except that we can add the effects of `\(x_1\)` being true and `\(x_2\)` being true.

---
class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

### Dummy Variables fall under the category of "specification"
- All of the rules about `\(x\)`'s still hold
  - MLR3 - No Multicolinearity
- Dummies don't change the way we estimate equations or coefficients
- Dummies don't change our assumptions or use of the residuals `\(\hat{u}\)`
- Dummies don't change *how* we calculate `\(\hat{\beta}\)`, `\(se(\hat{\beta})\)`, or `\(SSR\)` etc.

### Dummies *do* (hopefully) improve our model
- By accounting for and explaining variation that continuous variables don't
- And by being "interpretable"
  - Lots of ways we can account/explain variation, but not all are "interpretable"

# Dummy Variables
### The dummy variable trap

What if we add a variable for under 65 as well?

|Out of Pocket|Age|Over65|Under65|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|7782|48|0|1|
|8136|63|0|1|
|9730|86|1|0|
|7928|66|1|0|
|...|...|...|...|

--

### Remember MLR3? No perfect colinearity? Uh-oh.


---
class: MSU
# Dummy Variables

### So we can't have `\(1(age&gt;65)\)` and `\(1(age&lt;65)\)`
- Because MLR.3, no multicolinearity
- We can only *identify* the *difference* between over/under 65.
  - The intercept, `\(\beta_0\)` is the intercept for the *base* level
  - The coefficient is the *intercept shift*.

# Panel Data

### Panel Data is what we all a dataset where we have multiple observations for each unit of observation
- We have a sample of 100 people
- For each person, we have 12 years of earnings
  - We have `\(N=100 \times 12 = 120\)`

### Or
- We have a sample of 15 countries
- For each country we have 30 years of infant mortality rates
  - We have `\(N=15 \times 30 = 450\)`

# Panel Data

### Contrast Panel Data with other types of data:

#### Time series data
- We have one observation per time period
- But of only one thing.
  - There are no concurrent time periods.

- **AAPL** has one time series of data

# Panel Data

### In the previous slide regression:
- This is similar to the male grouping from before
- It has a slightly different interpretation
  - We think there is something unobserved about `\(Cuba\)` that gives it a different average GDP, even conditional on POP.
  - The *dummy* is the *country-level effect* for all of the things about `\(Cuba\)` that change it's GDP overall, independent of POP.
  
  
### Now, consider that we could have three countries in the data
- We would have one `\(\beta_0\)` (the base level)
- And we would have **two** intercept shifts - one for each of the non-base levels

### When we allow there to be any number of binary indicators, we call them "fixed effects".

---
class: MSU
# Panel Data

### The most common form of Panel Data is Unit x Time
- That's what we have here: We observed Cuba over different time periods
- And Colombia over the same time periods

### So the fixed effect captures things about Cuba (relative to Colombia) that do not differ over time
- Things that are always there

### Of course, we can also have time fixed effects!
- If there is something different about, say, 2009 that is the same across multiple countries
- Like, say, a global recession...

Fixed effects with multiple groups

### [top](#Overview)

class: MSU
# Fixed Effects

### Last class, we covered a binary variable fixed effect
- One variable taking the value of `\(\{0,1\}\)`. For example
  - `\(1(female)\)`
  - `\(1(age&gt;65)\)`

### Interpretation
- A .orange[shift] in the intercept **relative to the base group**
  - Base group: `\(male\)`
  - Base group: `\(age&lt;65\)`
- The "base group" (or "base level") is represented in the intercept: `\(\beta_0\)`
- The other group(s) ( `\(female\)` , `\(age&gt;65\)` ) have shifted intercepts:
  - `\(\beta_0\)` for the base (male, under 65)
  - `\(\beta_0 + \beta_1\)` for a female under 65
  - `\(\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2\)` for a female over 65
  - `\(\beta_0 + \beta_2\)` for a male over 65

### Ceteris Paribus still applies
Interpretation of the dummy variable fixed effect coefficient is:
&gt; "The change in the expectation of Y from being in the group relative to being in the base group, *ceteris paribus*"

We are using "in the group" here to mean "the observations for which the dummy is true"

### The "base level" is very important
- Since the in-group intercept is `\(E[Y|in-group] = \beta_0 + \beta_1\)`, but the coefficient is `\(\beta_1\)`, we have to be careful.
- The coefficient is the *difference* between the base level and the in-group.
- The "base" group is sometimes called **the omitted level**

## Interpretation of `\(\{0,1\}\)` dummy variables

### In the Wooldridge example
`$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 1(female) + \beta_2 educ + u$$`
&gt; "Conditional on education, females make on average `\(\beta_1\)` more/less than males, ceteris paribus"

.footnote[More/less depending on whether or not the coefficient is negative]

# Fixed Effects


### In the age example:
`$$Out-of-pocket = \beta_0 + \beta_1 age + \beta_2 1(age&gt;65) + u$$`
&gt; "Individuals over 65 years of age pay `\(\beta_2\)` more/less in out-of-pocket expenses relative to those under 65, controlling for the linear effect of age, ceteris paribus"

Here, we have to be a little more specific since the fixed effect and the continuous variable, `\(age\)`, both refer to age. It would be strange to say "conditional on age, being 65 means paying `\(\beta_1\)` more/less".

# Fixed Effects

### We can have more than one fixed effect:
`$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 1(female) + \beta_2 1(age&gt;65) + u$$`
- `\(E[wage | male, under 65]\)` = `\(\beta_0\)`

--

- `\(E[wage | female, under 65]\)` = ??

--

- `\(E[wage | female, over 65]\)` = ??

Fixed effects with multiple groups

# Fixed Effects

### What if we have three groups?
Take *education* as an example - we can "bin" education into:

| High School or less | | 2- or 4-year college degree | | Graduate degree|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|"HS"||"College"||"Graduate"|

When this is represented with one variable, it's called a **categorical** variable

---
class: MSU
# Fixed Effects 

### Our three groups would work as follows:

|wage|experience|educ|education
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|9000|0|12|HS|
|20000|5|16|College|
|60000|12|14|College|
|27000|2|18|Graduate|
|32000|10|9|HS|

.footnote[In the US, primary (required) education is 12 years, undergraduate is 4 additional years, and graduate school is 2-5+ additional years.]

# Fixed Effects

### Base level with categorical variable
- There is still a "base level" (or "omitted level")
- It is *your* choice as to which one is the "base level"
  - Coefficient estimates will still add up the same.
  - Interpretability is easier if you choose wisely
  - We should choose "HS" as the "base level" here, so that estimates are relative to HS
    - This is incorporating *ordinal* information since we think `\(wage_{grad} &gt; wage_{college} &gt; wage_{HS}\)`
  
### Numeric representation
- To represent a categorical variable with 3 categories, we need to create **two** more columns
  - If there are `\(K\)` categories, then we need `\(K-1\)` new columns
  - Whichever one we don't create a column for is the "base"
    - It's effect will be found in the `\(\beta_0\)` (the intercept)
    
---
class: MSU
# Fixed Effects

### Using "HS" as the base level:
|wage|experience|education|education==College|education==Graduate|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|9000|0|HS|0|0|
|20000|5|College|1|0|
|60000|12|College|1|0||
|27000|2|Graduate|0|1|
|32000|10|HS|0|0|

If we run this in R (leaving out the "education" column), we would get a coefficient for `\(education==College\)` and `\(education==Graduate\)`
- These would be the increase in the expected wage resulting from moving between the HS group to the College (or Graduate, respectively) group, *ceteris paribus*.

In R, categorical variables are a special type of variable called "**factor**"


.small[.pseudocode[df$education = as.factor(df$education)]]

### A "within-group" interpretation
- Group fixed effects explain the *mean* of the `\(y\)` variable within that group
  - E.g. our Cuba/Colombia example on Monday
  - The intercept is just the difference in means (conditional on the other `\(x\)`'s)
  

- The group fixed effect accounts for the averge difference *between* groups
  - And leaves the rest of the `\(x\)`'s to explain the variation in `\(y\)` *within* the group
  
  
- If we think of "partialling out" the fixed effect, this makes even more sense.

---
class: MSU
# Fixed Effects

Let's go to our wage/education/experience example. We might think there is a "gender experience gap" where men tend to be more experienced (e.g. due to not giving birth):
`$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 1(female) + \beta_2 experience + u$$`

Partial out the fixed effect:
`$$experience = \delta_0 + \delta_1 1(female) + v$$`

`\(\hat{v}\)` is `\(experience\)` that isn't associated with being female. It has had the "gender experience gap" *removed*.

That is, the variation in `\(\hat{v}\)` does not reflect the "male experience gap", so we are *identifying* `\(\beta_2\)` off of variation within the group, eliminating variation between `\(male\)` and `\(female\)`.



---
class: MSU
# Fixed Effects

### So, a regression using `\(\hat{v}\)` in place of `\(experience\)`:

`$$wage = \beta_0 + \beta_2 \hat{v}$$`
Gives us the correct `\(\beta_2\)` (remember our "partialling out" of `\(x_1,x_2\)`) using the "within group" variation in `\(experience\)`.

### Time fixed effects
What if we have `\(N\)` observations and `\(T\)` time periods (a common type of panel data), but instead of worrying about group-level differences giving us biased estimates, we worried that some time trend or time-specific shock is making one time period different from the others?

Here, let's look at (entirely fake) data on North American GDP and EXPORT (share of GDP from exports).

We want to know if higher EXPORTS are associated with higher GDP.

### Yes, you can specify more than one set of categorical variables
- Just as you can have more than one dummy variable
- The interpretation of each one is still the same: the effect of being in the group/time period relative to the base group/time period, *ceteris paribus*.
- These are called **two-way fixed effects** (TWFE)
  - When used on panel data
  - And when there is one fixed effect for each of the panel data's dimensions
    - `\(N\)` countries and `\(T\)` years here.

Interactions with Dummies

### [top](#Overview)

class: MSU
# Interactions

### Dummy variables shift *the intercepts*
- Very useful when a group (or time) has a different mean

- Covers *"unobserved, time-invariant differences"*

### But what if we think that the *slopes* differ
- For instance, maybe each country in our GDP/EXPORT example has *it's own unique relationship* between `\(GDP\)` and `\(EXPORT\)`?

- This can be *in addition* to thinking that each country has its own unique intercept
  - In fact, it would be odd to think that they'd have their own unique slope but *not* a unique intercept.

# Interactions

### How do we let the slopes vary?
- In a way very similar to letting the intercepts vary
- Let's look at it in an example with only two categories (a single dummy)

`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 1(condition) + \beta_2 x_1 + \underbrace{\beta_3 \times x_1 \times 1(condition)}_{\text{The interaction term}} + u$$`

### A couple things to note:
- `\(x_1\)` is our variable of interest here
- `\(condition\)` is our group dummy (like `\(male\)` or `\(age&gt;65\)` )
- `\(x_1\)` appears twice, once with `\(\beta_2\)`, and *again* in the interaction of `\(x_1 \times 1(condition)\)`

---

# Interactions

`$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 1(condition) + \beta_2 x_1 + \underbrace{\beta_3 x_1 1(condition)}_{\text{The interaction term}} + u$$`
Refreshing our interpretation of the intercept:
- The intercept for the base group is `\(\beta_0\)`
- The intercept for the in-group defined by `\(condition\)` is `\(\beta_0 + \beta_1\)`
--


Applying the same thought process to the interaction:
- **For the base group**, the marginal change in `\(y\)` from a unit increase in `\(x_1\)` is `\(\beta_2\)`
- **For the in-group**, the marginal change in `\(y\)` from a unit increase in `\(x_1\)` is `\(\beta_2 + \beta_3\)`

`$$\text{For the base group: }\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta{x_1}} = \beta_2$$`

`$$\text{For the in-group:   }\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta{x_1}} = \beta_2 + \beta_3$$`

---
class: MSU
# Interactions

### Of course, we can have &gt;2 groups (categorical)
`$$\begin{eqnarray}
y = \beta_0 &amp;+&amp; \beta_1 1(group==2) + \beta_3 1(group==3) + \beta_4 x_1  \\
&amp;+&amp; \beta_5 x_1 1(group==2) + \beta_6 x_1 1(group==3) + u
\end{eqnarray}$$`

---
class: MSU
# Interactions 

### What does that look like?
|wage|experience|educ|educ = College|educ = Graduate|experience x educ == College|experience x educ == Graduate|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|9000|0|HS|0|0|0|0|
|20000|5|College|1|0|5|0|
|60000|12|College|1|0|12|0|
|27000|2|Graduate|0|1|0|2|
|32000|10|HS|0|0|0|0|

---
class: MSU
# Interactions

### And in R:
.pseudocode[lm(wage ~ as.factor(educ) + exper + as.factor(educ)*exper, data=df)]

Here, you'll get **intercept .orange[shift]** coefficients on:
- educ = College
- educ = Grad


And you'll get **slope .orange[shift]** coefficients on:
- experience for educ = College
- experience for educ = Graduate

---
class: MSU
# Interactions 

### The wage/education/experience regression would be:
`$$\begin{eqnarray}
wage = \beta_0 &amp;+&amp; \beta_1 1(educ==College) + \beta_2 1(educ==Grad) + \beta_3 exper \\
&amp;+&amp; \beta_4 x_1 1(educ==Coll) + \beta_5 x_1 1(educ==Grad) + u
\end{eqnarray}$$`
### Expected Values conditional on X:
- `\(E[wage|exper, educ = HS] = \beta_0 + \beta_3 \times exper\)`
- `\(E[wage|exper, educ = Coll] = (\beta_0 + \beta_1) + (\beta_3 + \beta_4) \times exper\)`
- `\(E[wage|exper, educ = Grad] = (\beta_0 + \beta_2) + (\beta_3 + \beta_5) \times exper\)`

### Just as we do with the intercepts, we add to the base level
- Note that when we have three categories `\(\{HS,Coll,Grad\}\)` and we want the `\(E[wage|exper, educ==Grad]\)`, we do **not** add in the intercept-shift or slope-shift for `\(educ==Coll\)`.

The true slopes (since this is fictional data) are:

| educ | Slope |
|:---:|:---:|
| HS | 1|
| Coll |4|
| Grad | 5|

---
class: MSU
# Interactions

### How would we say this?
&gt; `\(\beta_4\)` is the college-specific increase in the relationship between per-year-of-experience and wages relative to HS graduates

- We can also just think of it in terms of slope: a positive `\(\beta_4\)` means the slope is steeper (more up) than HS

### Significance
- The statistical test that is output in these regressions refers to whether or not that coefficient is zero
- For a intercept-shift ( `\(\beta_1\)` or `\(\beta_2\)` ), the test tells us whether or not the *intercept* (or *mean*) outcome of the in-group is different from the base level.
- For a slope-shift (interaction, e.g. `\(\beta_3\)` or `\(\beta_4\)` ), the test tells us whether or not the *slope* is different of the in-group is different from the base level.
  - That is, it asks: "does this group have a *different relationship between exper and wage* than the base group?"

# Interactions

### Two-dummy interactions:
`$$\begin{eqnarray}
Out-of-pocket = \beta_0 &amp;+&amp; \beta_1 1(single) + \beta_2 1(age&gt;65) \\
&amp;+&amp; \beta_3 1(single) 1(age&gt;65) + u
\end{eqnarray}$$`

We have the same interpretation for `\(\beta_0\)` thru `\(\beta_2\)`
- **But** `\(\beta_3\)` tells us the `\(E[Out-of-pocket|\text{both things true}]\)`

### This means a single person over 65 adds *four* beta's together:
- `\(E[O-o-p|\text{married, 64 years old}] = \beta_0\)`
- `\(E[O-o-p|\text{single, 64 years old}] = \beta_0 + \beta_1\)`
- `\(E[O-o-p|\text{married, 66 years old}] = \beta_0 + \beta_2\)`
- `\(E[O-o-p|\text{single, 66 years old}] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3\)`

This is because a single person over 65 is all four things at once. `\(\beta_3\)` is interpreted as the additional effect of being *both* &gt;65 and single.
